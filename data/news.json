We must take on personal responsibility in terms of protecting ourselves,\u201d the Minister said.<\/p>\n<p>He urged citizens to take the lead in cleaning up their home surroundings and not to sit by waiting for the Government to visit their homes to do what they should be doing on a consistent basis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cContaining and controlling the disease cannot be the responsibility of government alone. Citizens must take responsibility for their own protection and also the protection of those in their households. It requires a comprehensive and integrated approach with government, private sector, citizen associations and the churches, because homes, places of work and places of worship are some of the areas where we see the Aedes Egypti mosquitoes,\u201d the Minister noted.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that after consultations, the Ministry of Health would be spearheading a national clean-up day, which would be concentrating on certain areas that are the likely breeding sites of the deadly mosquitoes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have identified funding, and I have had several meetings with the Mayors, parish councils, Minister of Tourism and Entertainment, Education Ministry, Food for the Poor, Private Sector Organization of Jamaica and a host of other crucial groups and organizations, all of whom have committed to help in this onslaught to destroy mosquito breeding sites and to step up on the public education programme,\u201d the Minister informed.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Ferguson called on all Jamaicans to support the initiative, as the country unite in a worthwhile project to benefit all citizens, especially the most vulnerable &#8211; the young, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Minister of Health, Hon.

Portia Simpson Miller, today (October 4) led the clean-up effort to control the spread of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in her South West St. Andrew constituency.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Simpson Miller, who was accompanied by Health Minister, Hon. Dr. Fenton Ferguson, joined community members in the Payne Land Division, along Spanish Town Road, in clearing the area of debris and possible mosquito breeding sites.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative, which got underway at\u00a07:00 a.m., also saw representatives from several government agencies and private sector organisations taking part.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking with JIS News, Mrs. Simpson Miller, said she was pleased by the tremendous turnout and encouraged all Jamaicans across the island to stage similar activities in their communities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is something we should promote across the country in terms of community members keeping their surroundings clean. I hope that we will not only have the communities clean today, but persons will also ensure that their surroundings stay clean and beautiful for themselves and the senior citizens,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Simpson Miller also encouraged other Members of Parliament to lead similar activities in their constituencies. \u201cI want to commend the Leader of the Opposition for committing to doing a clean-up in his constituency. I think if we set the example and lay the foundation, it will happen across the country,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The Prime Minister also thanked Councillor Audrey Smith Facey and Digicel Jamaica for partnering with the Government to undertake the clean-up.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Simpson Miller appealed to other private sector companies to join in the clean-up efforts, encouraging them to partner with community members in the areas that they operate to assist in cleaning up the country.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Minister Ferguson informed that the Government will be allocating additional funds to help fight the spread of ChikV and to mobilise communities in further clean-up efforts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will make the announcement next week in terms of the funding and we will announce the official roll out of the overall national clean-up, which is being coordinated by the JEEP Secretariat, in partnership with local authorities, tourism, \u00a0Mayors, and the private sector,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Ferguson also noted that he will be leading his own clean-up efforts in his Eastern St. Thomas constituency, next week Saturday (October 11).<\/p>\n<p>For her part, Corporate Relations Manager, Digicel Jamaica, Tricia Williams Singh, said the telecommunications company was pleased to partner with the Government in undertaking such a worthwhile venture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will continue to support any initiative, which is in the best interest of our country and people,\u201d Mrs. Singh added.<\/p>\n<p>Palm Tree Grove resident, Allan McKenzie, said he was very grateful for the clean-up activity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good programme and I like what the Prime Minister is doing. We appreciate it a lot and we are grateful for the clean-up. And, we thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health for coming out and helping us,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Among the agencies and private sector companies participating in\u00a0the clean-up were: National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA); Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM); Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC); and the Ministry of Local Government.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"galleria photocrati-nextgen_pro_horizontal_filmstrip \" data-id=\"87155\" id=\"displayed_gallery_87155\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<script type=\"text\/x-galleria-style-template\" id=\"css_overrides_87155\">\n\t\t.galleria-stage .galleria-image img {\n\t\n\t\tborder-color: #ffffff;\n\t}\n.galleria-thumbnails-container {\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-thumbnails .galleria-image {\n\twidth: 120px;\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-stage {\n\tbottom: 96px;\n}\t<\/script>\n\t<div class=\"galleria-batch\" style=\"display: none\" id=\"displayed_gallery_batch_87155\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ngg-image-0\" class=\"batch-image\" >\n         <img\n             data-title=\"p9\"\n             data-alt=\"p9\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p9.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/thumbs\/thumbs_p9.jpg\"\n             width=\"835\"\n             height=\"1280\"\n             data-image-id=\"2561\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n         \/>\n         <noscript>\n             <img\n                 title=\"p9\"\n                 alt=\"p9\"\n                 src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p9.jpg\"\n                 width=\"835\"\n                 height=\"1280\"\n                 data-image-id=\"2561\"\n                 data-description=\"\"\n                 \/>\n         <\/noscript>\n\t  <\/div> \n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ngg-image-1\" class=\"batch-image\" >\n         <img\n             data-title=\"p10\"\n             data-alt=\"p10\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p10.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/thumbs\/thumbs_p10.jpg\"\n             width=\"912\"\n             height=\"1280\"\n             data-image-id=\"2562\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n         \/>\n         <noscript>\n             <img\n                 title=\"p10\"\n                 alt=\"p10\"\n                 src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p10.jpg\"\n                 width=\"912\"\n                 height=\"1280\"\n                 data-image-id=\"2562\"\n                 data-description=\"\"\n                 \/>\n         <\/noscript>\n\t  <\/div> \n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ngg-image-2\" class=\"batch-image\" >\n         <img\n             data-title=\"p15\"\n             data-alt=\"p15\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p15.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/thumbs\/thumbs_p15.jpg\"\n             width=\"1280\"\n             height=\"1044\"\n             data-image-id=\"2563\"\n             data-description=\"\"\n         \/>\n         <noscript>\n             <img\n                 title=\"p15\"\n                 alt=\"p15\"\n                 src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/chik-v-clean-up\/p15.jpg\"\n                 width=\"1280\"\n                 height=\"1044\"\n                 data-image-id=\"2563\"\n                 data-description=\"\"\n                 \/>\n         <\/noscript>\n\t  <\/div> \n\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ngg-trigger-buttons ngg-trigger-large\"><i data-nplmodal-gallery-id=\"76acb63a465fa8e6962c0e8c49a1761d\" class=\"sb icon-share-sign ngg-trigger  nextgen_pro_lightbox\"><\/i><\/div><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Prime Minister, the Most Hon.

are expected in the island to participate in the 2014 staging of the association\u2019s regional conference from October 6-7. Speaking at a JIS \u2018Think Tank\u2019 on October 3, Secretary General of CASHFI, Joseph Bailey, expressed confidence that the conference will assist regional governments to shape policies that will ensure the sustainability of the housing sector.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Bailey explained that traditional methods of housing acquisitions have changed and the conference will address strategies to adapt to those changes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the most critical conference we\u2019ve undertaken largely because of the transformation that is taking place in the international financial sector. The main reason is that a number of countries are finding it difficult to mobilise savings to provide the financing that housing requires, therefore we are forced to look at different modalities,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that in the last few years there has been contraction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across the region, citing the significant reduction in revenue from the bauxite industry in Jamaica, as an example.<\/p>\n<p>According to Mr. Bailey, one of the expected outcomes of the conference is to develop a concept for a housing policy to set the framework for a paradigm shift. The policy, he said, should make housing affordable and reduce the housing deficit in the region. He added that it would assist the region to meet the housing needs of its population which is growing faster than the current new housing stock.<\/p>\n<p>The conference will be held at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, in Kingston,\u00a0 under the theme: \u2018Transforming Regional Communities through Housing and Economic Development\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The findings of the conference will be produced in the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) publication: \u2018New Study on Latin America &amp; Caribbean; Housing Opportunities for the Majority\u2019, early in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Key partners in the hosting of the conference include the National Housing Trust (NHT) and the IDB.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Representatives from 12-member countries of the Caribbean Association of Housing Finance Institutions (CASHFI) are expected in the island to participate in the 2014 staging of the association\u2019s regional conference from October 6-7.

And the major thing was that I didn\u2019t have to pay any duty on the system, because of the Government\u2019s duty free policy on renewable energy systems,\u201d she told JIS News.<\/p>\n<p>She informed that her system, which includes 81 solar panels, now provides all the energy she needs to run her New Kingston business complex, which houses the Red Snapper Restaurant, the Thirsty Man pub, and Elegant Weddings.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Clunie is now in the process of applying for a licence from the Office of the Utilities Regulation (OUR) for Net Billing to sell excess energy to the Jamaica Public Service (JPS).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would encourage small business owners to just get with the programme. The fact is I am now much better off and this system will pay for itself in about 18 to 20 months,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Minister Paulwell told JIS News that the installation of the system demonstrates the importance of using those incentives that the government has provided to small businesses to lower their cost of electricity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a good model for small businesses and it has slashed their electricity usage and costs significantly, making the business so much more viable and productive,\u201d he noted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, when we say that each person has a responsibility to reduce the cost of electricity, this is one of the models that we want to promote,\u201d the Minister said.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed out that once the system is installed, it is maintenance free for almost 20 years. \u201cYou make back your money in four years and you\u2019re able to generate a significant profit from it, so it is definitely a win, win,\u201d the Minister said.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A New Kingston business owner is reaping the benefits of reduced energy costs, following the installation of a US$30,000 photovoltaic solar system at her premises.

Edwards \u2013 Senior Citizen Leading By Example","title_plain":"Beverly Edwards \u2013 Senior Citizen Leading By Example","content":"<p>There is no slowing down for the passionate and vivacious senior citizen, Beverly Edwards, who continues to play a vital role in national development.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Westmoreland and raised in St. Mary with her grandparents,\u00a0Mrs. Edwards learnt, from an early age, the importance of hard work and respect for others. These are traits which have allowed her to excel in adulthood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI learnt to do things on my own from an early age. I had to be very respectful to the people in my community. I could not pass adults on the road and not say hello to them because when I got home I would get a spanking,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She is described by those who know her best as organised, loving, and compassionate, but very stern. Mrs. Edwards attributes her caring demeanor to her grandmother, who, she says, instilled essential values.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I would get up in the mornings and not know where my grandmother had gone. She got up early, looked about breakfast, and then went out to look for those who were ill or she took breakfast to them; and I grew up just like that, having that caring attitude for people,\u201d Mrs. Edwards recalls.<\/p>\n<p>Her disciplined upbringing was further cemented when she moved to Kingston at the age of 12 to live with her father, who was a soldier. She says while living with him she learnt to be to very thorough, as he always ensured that she was always properly attired, even when she grew into adulthood.<\/p>\n<p>First introduced to public speaking as a child, Mrs. Edwards says that was the catalyst for her active involvement in her community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI played an active role in my community, [because] from an early age I started to do public speaking, which I love so much, when they used to put me on a little box at church to recite poems,\u201d she recalls.<\/p>\n<p>She has dedicated 40 years to the public sector beginning in 1970 at the Ministry of Local Government where she worked as a Registry Clerk for seven years.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Edwards was then transferred to the Jamaica Information Service (JIS) where she assumed the position of Chief Records Manager. Always the one to inject some fun into any activity, she founded a sports club, which she says was very active.<\/p>\n<p>However, after five years with the JIS, she decided it was time to pursue other interests. She moved on to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to take up the job of Investigations Officer and later became a social worker at the National Council for Senior Citizens (NCSC). Mrs. Edwards worked at the Council until her retirement in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>She points out that working with senior citizens was very fulfilling. \u201cWorking with the seniors, you learn a lot from them; and so while working with them, I gained a lot of experiences. I also learnt to accept them.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes they seem miserable but \u2026allow them to do what they feel like doing, and guide them,\u201d she expresses.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Edwards was also an advocate in her own right. For over 25 years, she dedicated herself to the Jamaica Civil Service Association as departmental representative for the Ministry of Local Government, the NCSC, as well as the JIS.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI always like to speak out on the rights of my co-workers and always saying to them that\u2026I will defend you when you are right [but] if you are wrong, it is not going to be me, because at all times we [must] aim to do the right thing,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Her hard work has not gone unnoticed. Mrs. Edwards has received numerous awards for her years of service to the NCSC, the Jamaica Civil Service Association, the Jamaica 4H Clubs, and her community.<\/p>\n<p>She is also a 2010 National Honours and Awards recipient of the Badge of Honour for long and faithful service to the elderly and community.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Edwards is also credited for being the brainchild of the much-anticipated \u2018Seniors Spelling Bee Competition\u2019, an annual fixture of the NCSC.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went to bed one night in 2003 and I said I need something exciting for the seniors to do in 2004; and it came to me that I should do a spelling bee competition and after [consultations with the seniors] they decided that they would like it. We started in Kingston and St. Andrew and then it became a national focus where all 14 parishes participate,\u201d she recalls.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the 63 year old enjoys benefits from some of the programmes she implemented at the Council while she was coordinator for Kingston and St. Andrew. On Monday and Thursday mornings she can be found at the Kingston and St. Andrew Parish Library receiving training in computer literacy. This is the very programme she instituted while she worked with the NCSC in St. Thomas.<\/p>\n<p>Ingrid Hardy, the current NCSC coordinator for Kingston and St. Andrew says she easily took over the reins when Mrs. Edwards retired because of how organised the retiree kept her files.<\/p>\n<p>Although Mrs. Edwards left the Council three years ago, Mrs. Hardy says she is still very much involved in its affairs as she often volunteers her time there. She also adds that, for Mrs. Edwards, working with seniors was more than a job.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe did not work here just [because it was her] job\u2026one day she said to me \u201cHardy, I love my job with all my life.\u201d She would use her own money, she would use her time and her weekends just to get the job done,\u201d Mrs. Hardy says of her predecessor.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to being a volunteer at the Council, Mrs. Edwards is also the coordinator for the senior dance group, \u2018the Recycled Teenagers\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Edwards states that what keeps her going is her philosophy taken from a Bible scripture, \u201cI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>She is encouraging persons to embrace challenges, make the best use of their opportunities, and to show respect to others.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of challenges. Life is short and whatever we can do to help somebody [let us do it]\u2026do all the good you can. Today you are on this side of the counter, tomorrow you are going to be on the other side of the counter asking for assistance. So be good and treat people with respect,\u201d says Mrs. Edwards.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>There is no slowing down for the passionate and vivacious senior citizen, Beverly Edwards, who continues to play a vital role in national development.
